   ANSWERS

1. *Augmented Intelligence (AI) vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI):*

*A. According to definitions:*

- *Augmented Intelligence (AI):* Augmented Intelligence refers to the use of technology to enhance and complement human intelligence, decision-making, and problem-solving capabilities. It focuses on collaboration between humans and machines, where the technology assists humans in making better decisions rather than replacing them.

- *Artificial Intelligence (AI):* Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and perception. AI systems can operate autonomously, often without human intervention.

*B. According to purpose:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* The primary goal is to empower humans by providing tools and insights that improve their decision-making and efficiency. It emphasizes human-machine collaboration.

- *Artificial Intelligence:* The primary goal is to create systems that can perform tasks autonomously, often aiming to replicate or surpass human capabilities in specific areas.

*C. According to human Involvement:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* Humans remain central to the decision-making process. The technology provides recommendations, insights, and data analysis, but the final decision rests with the human.

- *Artificial Intelligence:* AI systems can operate independently, making decisions and performing tasks without human intervention. Human involvement may be minimal or non-existent in some cases.

*D. According to applications:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* Commonly used in fields like healthcare (assisting doctors with diagnostics), finance (providing insights for investment decisions), and customer service (enhancing support agents' capabilities).

- *Artificial Intelligence:* Widely used in autonomous vehicles, natural language processing (e.g., chatbots), robotics, and complex data analysis (e.g., predictive analytics).

*E. According to ethical Considerations:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* Raises fewer ethical concerns regarding job displacement since it is designed to assist rather than replace humans. However, issues like data privacy and bias in recommendations still need to be addressed.

- *Artificial Intelligence:* Raises significant ethical concerns, including job displacement, decision-making transparency, and the potential for bias in autonomous systems. The lack of human oversight in some AI applications can lead to ethical dilemmas.

*F. According to complexity and Development:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* Generally involves less complex systems since the focus is on enhancing human capabilities rather than creating fully autonomous systems. Development often prioritizes user-friendly interfaces and interpretability.

- *Artificial Intelligence:* Involves more complex systems, especially in areas like deep learning and neural networks. Development focuses on creating systems that can learn and adapt independently, often requiring significant computational resources.

*F. According to Examples:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* IBM Watson in healthcare, where it assists doctors by providing data-driven insights; decision support systems in business analytics.

- *Artificial Intelligence:* Self-driving cars like those developed by Tesla; virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa; and advanced robotics used in manufacturing.
